# Tic-Tac-Toe Variations

This repository contains several variations of the Tic-Tac-Toe game, including traditional 3x3 boards, NxN customizable grids, and L-shaped boards. The games support both player-vs-player and player-vs-AI modes. Some versions also include a graphical user interface (GUI) built with tkinter.

## Notice
Please be aware that the performance of the AI algorithm may vary based on your computerâ€™s processing power and the size of the board. For larger boards or less powerful machines, it may take some time for the algorithm to find the best move. We appreciate your patience while the AI computes its move.
